        <h2>General Assembly Notes</h2>

        <p>Model kits are almost always packaged together in a box, with artwork depicting the style of model on the box. Usually of what the finished product would look like. These kits also are usually made to scale, such as "1:35" scale. This means that the model when finished, along with all the parts, is a 35th the size of the real item. The scale is usually stated in the corner of the box as well. Inside you'll find a mix of items from the parts, stickers or decals, instructions and other items depending on the difficulty of the kit.</p>

    <h3>1. The Kit</h3>

        <h3>2. Sprues</h3>
	<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Pictured above, is what is known in the hobby as a "sprue." Here is where all of the plastic parts to complete a model are located. This is also where you clipper tools will come into play, as the parts need to be removed from this frame. The parts appear in this state as they are formed in a model for production. But then need to be clipped or removed in order to piece them together. Parts removed from the sprue are then typically pieced together in order of the instructions, as each individual part will be labeled with a number. This is also where your super glue comes into play, as it is the best adhesive for connecting parts together to form a strong bond. </p>

        <h3>3. Decals</h3>
	<p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Inside the kit, the hobbyist will also find a decal sheet. These decals are often applied using warm water. The decals are cut from the sheet, and when water is applied to them, they can be removed from the sheet and slid onto the model. Some other models might even use stickers as the decals, which can sometimes be a bit easier to handle. The decals are accurate to what the model should look like in the real world. They can vary from all kinds of markings, logos, or even represent very small parts (such as door handles) that are just to small to print into a sprue. Decals are one of the last items that should be applied in the building process.</p>
