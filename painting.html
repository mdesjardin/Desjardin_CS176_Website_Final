        <h2>Painting and Weathering</h2>

        <p>The painting process is what makes any scale model come alive! Below are some pointers about the process, and what you can do to set yourself up for success!</p>

        <h3>1. Priming</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">The primimg stage is the first part of the painting process. Priming is the act of applying a base layer to the plastic surface of a model kit. This can be thought of as a type of buffer layer between the plastic and the paint. Paint has a hard time sticking to a smooth plastic surface. So by applying this primer layer, it gives the paint a better surface to adhere to. The color of the primer is also important. Depending on the desired look of the model, a darker or lighter colored primer can change the way the top coat of paint will look. As paint is applied in thin layers, it could appear darker or lighter depending on the color of the primer layer. So it's an important consideration to make before moving forward! Priming a model will also prevent mistakes such as flaking or pealing paint, as most paint does not stick well to a basic plastic surface. </p>

        <h3>2. Painting</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">When it comes to painting the model, there are several options as to which route to take. As mentioned before, we can paint a model with regular brushes, an airbrush or even using spray paint cans if the color is what we want. It is best to assemble as much of the model as possible before starting to paint. It can be tricky to tape off small pieces of a model that have already been painted first. So it is recommened to paint the entire model in the main color first, and use paint brushes to take care of the fine detail items after. Such as painting headlights, tools, or any sort of accent pieces. It's also important to note that multiple light coats of paint are better than trying to complete the paint job in one pass with a heavy layer. It'll take much longer to dry, and sometimes looks off as certain areas might become covered in this heavy layer. This could include putting to much paint on small details, causing them to become hidden.</p>

        <h3>3. Weathering</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">Weathering is a great process, done at the end of a build, which can help make a model look like it's real. Weathering is the act of applying small details such as scratches, mud, rust, exposed metal, and dirt which makes it look like something has been out in the elements. A model car could have dirt applied into it's tire treads, or a piece of heavy machinery might have rust and scratches near heavily used areas as it would in the real world. Companies even sell weathering materials such as dirt and rust that can be applied in a similar manner to painting. These effects really help to make a scale model come alive, especially when it matches the real wear patterns of the real thing! </p>
