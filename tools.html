        <h2>Required Tools</h2>

        <p>In order to build models, there's a few required tools needed to get the job done. Below I'll display a few of the most important ones. But It's certainly not limited to this selection!</p>

        <h3>Clippers</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
            Having a good set of clippers can go a long way when you're putting together a model kit. Since many parts a stuck together on a mold, having a sharp set can make life much easier during the assembly process. Clippers with a dull edge or of poor quality could leave behind unwanted pieces of plastic from the mold itself. Also, having a few different types of clippers can be an advantage as well. Some parts of a model kit can be very small, and having a range of clippers from small to large can improve your experience. Sometimes using the wrong pair can lead to cutting sections of a part you might not need to, or not removing enough material.</p>

        <h3>Super Glue/Adhesive</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
            The type of adhesive used to put parts of a model together can be very important. Simply using regular glue doesn't always make the cut. Generally, we want to use something strong such as a type of super glue. This way, small parts connect together with a strong bond. We can also be confident that the model is less delicate when moving it around. It's important to note as well, that not all super glue will bond certain plastics. So it's very important to double check the material your model is made of, and picking the proper type of glue to make sure you get strong bonds when building! You don't want to have your beautiful creation falling apart only weeks after putting in all the effort!</p>

        <h3>Airbrush</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
            An airbrush is one of the best tools for painting model kits. Instead of having to worry about leaving brush strokes when painting, an airbrush allows for a smooth, thin layer of paint. It often comes out as an even layer, applied over a coat of primer. They also allow for fine details or for painting larger areas, as they can typically be adjusted from a fine point to a large spray pattern. Airbrush tools often need to use special paint, or "airbrush paint," which is usually much thinner and closer to a liquid form than most other types of paint. This allows the paint to spray smoothly without clogging. Airbrushes come in a wide range of prices and quality, but even a simple one can do a fine job!</p>

        <h3>Sand Paper</h3>
        <p style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right: 5%; font-family:'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">
            A selection of different grades of sandpaper are extremely helpful to help fine-tune any model build. Sand paper helps to refine rough edges on plastic or wood surfaces. This can help make our model kits look real, instead of leaving behind odd seems that wouldn't be there in real life. Using different grades of sandpaper is also handy. A rough grade can help to even make a flat surface have more texture, while a smooth grade can help clean up and imperfections! Sanding a model before applying primer in the painting process is also a good trick, it'll help give a smooth surface a little bit of texture to help the primer stick to the surface!</p>
