        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>Building scale models is a hobby with millions of followers. Many people choose to build models about anything from vehicles, characters, landscapes, and all types of dioramas to depict certain scenes. It's a hobby where you can constantly be learning new skills everytime you start a new project. It allows for endless creativity and imagination, as we can build and paint anything we want! There are many ways that models can be built. Plastic kits, metal kits, wood, and other types of resin materials. They can also be painted and weathered in hundreds of different styles, as everyone has their own techniques. In this website, I'll take you through some of the basics about the hobby of scale modeling, and why it's one of my favorite pass times!</p>
